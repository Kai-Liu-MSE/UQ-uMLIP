The full OMat24 dataset contains ~100 million structures.
The test set of OMat24 contains ~1 million structures.
The full predictions by the 21 UMLIPs is too large so here provides 3% of the test set, which contains ~30,000 configurations.

RMSE_of_Energy_Force_Predicted_by_UMLIP:
Calculate the RMSE of force and energy prediction by UMLIPs. 
The force RMSEs are used to calculated the weights for ensemble-based uncertainty quantification.
